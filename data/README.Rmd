**Data will not be uploaded to github.**

## 1. How will data be collected

##### [Access World News](http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/search/nb?p=AWNB&t=collection%3AAIN!Access%2BInternational%2BNews){#AWN}

Data was collected from Access World News, using the query "PATRIOT Act." Queries were run for major US Metro Papers[^1], and all US papers[^2]. These catagorizations are the ones designated by Access World News. Data was collected by running a scraper to collect all articles that returned a match for "PATRIOT Act" within the title or first (topic) paragraph of the news story.

### Queries

The "PATRIOT Act" query was chosen to allow results to be as unbiased as possible. The first paragraph limitation was chosen as scraping on only the title would have excluded articels that discussed the PATRIOT Act in relation to other topics of interest, but in which the Act itself was not the main focus. Artciels that mentioned the Act anywhere were excluded as these searches returned a significant amount of media (several times over the final corpus), which included only a single mention of the PATRIOT Act, often in an off-handed way (such as the transcript of a local comedian). The topic paragrap restricted search was felt to be a compromize between these two sub-par oprions. 

## 2. Where will raw data be stored

Raw data (full texts and metadata) are stored within the `./data/raw/` directory of this project. Each query will have its own sub-directory within the raw data folder, by source, and scope of query. Each query containd a META.txt file which contains the parameter used for the query, as well as a link to each individual article scraped. Each article is saved as an html file, contaning a print out of the Access World News page containing the article. They are numbered 1-n corresponding to the links in the META.txt file. A "News Sources" file is also included which lists all newspapers queried from for that search.

## 4. How will data be cleaned?

Articles were first scraped from their html files into a data fame containing the full text or the article and date, as well as the newspaper source, author, section of the paper, and Access World News record number. The raw text was then cleaned by converting the text to lower case, removing duplicate articles, removing URLs, and removing stories coming from the entertainment section of the paper. Text was then lematized using [Tree Tagger](http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/).

## 5. How was data analyzed?

Data was first plotted along time to show when the PATRIOT Act was discussed publicly. Spikes in mentions were then research to discover what events of that time could have been responsible for those spikes in interest. A 1 month window was taken around the peak of each spike (so if an event happened in Septmber, a model would be creating containing Augest, Septmeber, and October), and topic models were created for that time. These models are compared over time to see in relation to what the PATRIOT Act was being discussed. 

## 6. How was analyzed data named?

The resulting topic models will be named to describe the center event of their 2 month span. Each will be given its own directory under `./data/models/`. Within this directory there will be a .rda filw contaning the topic model, all paramets, as well as wordclouds for all topics.
